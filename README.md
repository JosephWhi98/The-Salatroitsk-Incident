- Made in 48 Hours for Ludum Dare 49 for the theme 'Unstable' - 

'The Salatroitsk Incident' is a  short PSX-style horror game set in a fictional Russian city after a nuclear incident. You've been sent to collect rock samples for research purposes, however have been warned of rumours of a strange mutant abomination roaming the area. Collect 6 samples by following readings on your Giger counter and escape before the monstrous abomination fuses your body into its bubbling fleshy mass. 



How to play:

Use your Giger counter to track down and collect the 6 radiation samples. The CPM will be higher as you get closer to targets.

Keep your distance from the abomination, shooting it will cause it to temporarily retreat, however this will be less effective as you collect more samples.

Once all samples have been collected, find your way back to your vehicle to escape.
